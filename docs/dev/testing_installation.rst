Trying out test releases
########################

Thanks for being willing to try out a test release! We strongly recommend that you do this in a virtual
environment. If you don't have one set up, you can create one with `conda` or `mamba` (use whichever one you have installed)::

    mamba create -n stellarphot-test python=3.11
    mamba activate stellarphot-test
    pip install --pre stellarphot
